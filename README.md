# Wifi Router Password Hacker

## Description

It is just a simple POJO application, which aims for figuring out what the password of the wifi router that is linked to my own router is.
When I tried to set up port-forwarding on my wifi router, I realized the router was also linked to another router. To finish the task, I needed to hack the password of it and to set up port-forwarding, so I created a simple brute-force hacker.
This application generates 6-digits combinations of num 0-9 and uppercase alphabet.
